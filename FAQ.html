      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Which versions of Akka and Spray is <em>{{ site.version }}</em> compatible with?</h3>
      <p>
        Version {{ site.version }} of <em>riak-scala-client</em> is compatible with Akka 2.1.x
        (currently tested against 2.1.4) and Spray 1.1-M8.
      </p><p>
        Because quite a few people are eagerly jumping on the Akka 2.2 bandwagon, there is also
        a version 0.8.1.2, which is compatible with Aka 2.2-RC1 and Spray 1.2-M8.
      </p>


      <h3>Will there ever be support for the Riak protobuf API?</h3>
      <p>
        Maybe. It is certainly not a priority for 1.0 but the http protocol does come with
        some encoding problems so we might migrate towards protobug in the future.
      </p></p>
        If you want protobuf support faster, please make your wishes known by creating an issue
        or a pull request!.

      <h3>Why such a boring name?</h3>
      <p>
        It seems all the cool and appropriate names, like <a href="https://github.com/xaleraz/Riaktive">riaktive</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/timperrett/riakka">riakka</a>, <a href="https://github.com/benmyles/riaktor">riaktor</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/ariejdl/scala-riak">scalariak</a>, etc. have already
        been taken by other projects. But there seems to be a common riak-xxx-client naming
        pattern used by Riak client libraries for other languages
        so that's what ended up deciding the, admittedly boring, name.
      </p></p>
        If you come up with a cooler name, please let us know and eternal fame will be yours!
