      <h3>Which version of Spray is <em>riak-scala-client</em> compatible with?</h3>
      <p>
        Version {{ site.version }} of <em>riak-scala-client</em> was developed in the
        vacuum between Spray 1.1-M7 and 1.1-M8. The <code>spray-client</code> module
        was heavily refactored early in the 1.1-M8 timeframe and we used the resulting new
        features expecting a quick release of 1.1-M8. However the Spray team then (February 2013)
        decided to start a massive refactoring and redesign process and as a result 1.1-M8
        has not been released yet (mid-March 2013).
      </p><p>
        While we all wait patiently for Spray 1.1-M8 to be released, <em>riak-scala-client</em>
        depends on a nightly build of Spray 1.1, namely 1.1-20130123. This version is very close
        to 1.1-M7 but includes the above-mentioned first refactoring of <code>spray-client</code>.
      </p><p>
        As soon as Spray 1.1-M8 (or later) is released, a compatible version of this library
        will be released ASAP.
      </p></p>
        All of this will not affect you very much unless you want to use this library in
        a project that depends on Spray 1.1-M7, esspecially <code>spray-client</code>. In that case
        unfortunately the only available choices are either to upgrade to the same nightly build
        of Spray or to not use this library until Spray releases 1.1-M8.

      <h3>Will there ever be support for the Riak protobuf API?</h3>
      <p>
        You never know, but probably not. It is certainly not a priority for 1.0 unless
        lots of people indicate 1.0 would not be complete without it.
      </p></p>
        If you are one of those people, please make your wishes know by creating an issue
        or a pull request!.

      <h3>Why such a boring name?</h3>
      <p>
        It seems all the cool and appropriate names, like <a href="https://github.com/xaleraz/Riaktive">riaktive</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/timperrett/riakka">riakka</a>, <a href="https://github.com/benmyles/riaktor">riaktor</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/ariejdl/scala-riak">scalariak</a>, etc. have already
        been taken by other projects. But there seems to be a common riak-xxx-client naming
        pattern used by Riak client libraries for other languages
        so that's what ended up deciding the, admittedly boring, name.
      </p></p>
        If you come up with a cooler name, please let us know and eternal fame will be yours!
