      <h3>Why such a boring name?</h3>
      <p>
        It seems all the cool and appropriate names, like <a href="https://github.com/xaleraz/Riaktive">riaktive</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/timperrett/riakka">riakka</a>, <a href="https://github.com/benmyles/riaktor">riaktor</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/ariejdl/scala-riak">scalariak</a>, etc. have already
        been taken by other projects. But there seems to be a common riak-xxx-client naming
        pattern used by Riak client libraries for other languages
        so that's what ended up deciding the, admittedly boring, name.
      </p></p>
        If you come up with a cooler name, please let us know and eternal fame will be yours!

      <h3>Will there ever be support for the Riak protobuf API?</h3>
      <p>
        You never know, but probably not. It is certainly not a priority for 1.0 unless
        lots of people indicate 1.0 would not be complete without it.
      </p></p>
        If you are one of those people, please make your wishes know by creating an issue
        or a pull request!.
